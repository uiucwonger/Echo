    <h1>Strava OAuth App Support</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome! This is the support page for the Echo Uploader app. It helps users connect Rogue Echo Rower to Strava activities.
    </p>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How do I connect my Strava account?</strong><br>
            Open the app and follow the on-screen instructions to log in with Strava.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Having trouble authenticating?</strong><br>
            Make sure you have a stable internet connection and the latest version of the app.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Why are my activities showing up as a Run in Strava?</strong><br>
            Strava shows activities as a "Run" because Strava does not read the sport type from the app's uploadedTCX files. You can manually change the activity type on Strava after upload, or use a Strava companion app <a href="https://www.activityfix.com/index" target="_blank">ActivityFix</a> to automatically correct it.
